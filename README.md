### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

Hi! I'm Thais, a developer with more than 9 years of experience in a wide range of disciplines. Currently I'm working with Angular 10+ and React JS.

My journey as a developer began in 2013 when I started studying in Senac University. This has helped me to widen my range of knowledge and gather experience through several disciplines, such as front-end, back-end, mobile apps, design, project management, and many more.

Since the beginning of my career as a developer, I have been working with up to date technologies, looking for high quality projects through clean code. Always thinking about a great user experience.
